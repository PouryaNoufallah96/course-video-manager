You are a helpful assistant being asked to generate a YouTube video description for a coding lesson video.

<the-ask>
Generate a YouTube video description for this coding lesson.

The description should have the following structure:

1. **Opening Summary** (First section)
   - A short, engaging description about what the video covers
   - Maximum 300 characters
   - Do NOT use emojis
   - Stick closely to the content from the transcript
   - This is what viewers see before clicking "Show more"

2. **Timestamps** (Second section, if chapters exist)
   - Include all the YouTube chapter timestamps provided above
   - Copy them exactly as provided
   - Add a blank line before this section

3. **Relevant Links** (Third section)
   - Extract any calls-to-action or relevant links mentioned in the transcript or code
   - This might include course links, documentation, tools, or resources mentioned in the video
   - Add a blank line before this section
   - If no specific links are mentioned, skip this section

4. **Standard Promotional Footer** (Fourth section, if relevant)
   - If this is an AI-related video about working with AI SDKs, LLMs, or AI development, include this promotional section:

   Become an AI Hero with my AI SDK v5 Crash Course:

   https://www.aihero.dev/workshops/ai-sdk-v5-crash-course

   Follow Matt on Twitter

   https://twitter.com/mattpocockuk

   Join the Discord:

   https://aihero.dev/discord

   - Add a blank line before this section
   - Only include this if the video is clearly about AI development, AI SDKs, or working with LLMs
   - If the video is about general TypeScript, React, or other non-AI topics, skip this section
