## Issue #100: Create disallowed phrases list in article lint rules

**Task completed**: Added disallowed LLM phrases to lint rules in the article writer

**Key decisions**:
- Created a `DISALLOWED_PHRASES` array for easy maintenance and extension
- Phrases are case-insensitive matched using RegExp with "gi" flags
- Initial phrases: "uncomfortable truth", "hard truth" (per issue comments)
- Rule applies to all modes (modes: null)
- Fix instruction tells the LLM to remove or rephrase the flagged phrases

**Files changed**:

**Blockers**: None

## Issue #99: Add article plan mode to article writer

**Task completed**: Added article plan mode to the write article page

**Key decisions**:
- Article plan mode creates structured outlines with H2 headings and ultra-concise bullet points
- Uses ListTreeIcon for UI representation (represents hierarchical outline structure)
- Prompt emphasizes: choosing own flow (not following source order), being ruthlessly selective, prioritizing mercilessly, leaving irrelevant content on cutting room floor
- Bullet points should sacrifice grammar for concision (skip articles, use shorthand, fragments OK)
- Output includes main learning goal and what was intentionally left out

**Files changed**:
- app/routes/videos.$videoId.completions.ts - Added "article-plan" to modeSchema
- app/prompts/generate-article-plan.ts - New prompt file for article planning
- app/services/text-writing-agent.ts - Added import and article-plan case to switch statement
- app/routes/videos.$videoId.write.tsx - Added UI: ListTreeIcon import, modeToLabel entry, SelectItem

**Blockers**: None

## Issue #98: Add brainstorming mode to article writer

**Task completed**: Added brainstorming mode to the write article page

**Key decisions**:
- Brainstorming mode follows the same pattern as interview mode but with different prompting
- Uses LightbulbIcon for the UI representation
- Shares the same dropdown copy behavior as interview mode (copy conversation history / copy last message)
- Prompt focuses on: exploring ideas, extending/deepening thinking, making connections, challenging assumptions, and offering new angles

**Files changed**:
- app/routes/videos.$videoId.completions.ts - Added "brainstorming" to modeSchema
- app/prompts/generate-brainstorming.ts - New prompt file for brainstorming facilitator
- app/services/text-writing-agent.ts - Added brainstorming case to switch statement
- app/routes/videos.$videoId.write.tsx - Added UI: icon import, modeToLabel entry, SelectItem, and dropdown behavior

**Blockers**: None
