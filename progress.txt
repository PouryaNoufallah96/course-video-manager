## Issue #1 - Beat dots orange → light grey
- Changed BeatIndicator dots from bg-orange-500 to bg-zinc-400
- File: app/features/video-editor/video-editor.tsx:886-894

## Issue #2 - Remove pause icon from video editor
- Removed PauseIcon from timecode overlay on clip thumbnails
- BeatIndicator (three ellipses) now serves as the only beat indicator
- Kept PauseIcon in context menu for "Add/Remove Beat" action
- File: app/features/video-editor/video-editor.tsx:730-732 (removed)

## Issue #5 - Scene-based overlay visibility
- Half-opaque overlay now only shows when current OBS scene matches previous clip's scene
- If no scene detected (OBS not connected or clip has no scene), defaults to showing overlay
- File: app/features/video-editor/video-editor.tsx:370-391

## Issue #6 - Changelog shows updated/changed videos
- Content changes (changed transcripts) were being detected but not displayed
- Added `updatedLessons` to `SectionChanges` type
- Track content changes when organizing changes by section
- Added "#### Updated" section in changelog output for lessons with transcript changes
- File: app/services/changelog-service.ts:220-226, 246, 266-269, 380, 423-431

## Issue #7 - Renames only count actual name changes, not number changes
- Previously, changing `01.03-choosing-your-model` to `01.04-choosing-your-model` was detected as a rename
- Added `stripNumericPrefix()` and `hasNameChanged()` helper functions
- Updated section rename detection to use `hasNameChanged()` instead of path inequality
- Updated lesson rename detection to use `hasNameChanged()` instead of path inequality
- Now only detects renames when the actual name portion changes (e.g., `streaming-objects` → `generating-objects-via-output`)
- File: app/services/changelog-service.ts:203-218, 123, 146

## Issue #3 - Export video from course page context menu
- Added "Export" option to video right-click context menu on course page
- Added `exportVideoFetcher` using React Router's `useFetcher` hook
- Export menu item posts to existing `/api/videos/$videoId/export` endpoint
- Uses Download icon to indicate export action
- File: app/routes/_index.tsx:266, 834-844

## Issue #8 - Publish not respecting repo versions
- Publish endpoint was using `getRepoWithSectionsById` which returns ALL sections for a repo, regardless of version
- Changed to first get the latest version via `getLatestRepoVersion`
- Then use `getRepoWithSectionsByVersion` to fetch only sections from the latest version
- This ensures only the latest version's sections are published to Dropbox
- File: app/routes/api.repos.publish-to-dropbox.ts:93-107

## Issue #9 - Add glossary to changelog
- Added a glossary section at the top of the changelog explaining what each term means

- Updated: The video has been updated and the readme needs to be rewritten
- Deleted: The lesson or section has been removed
- File: app/services/changelog-service.ts:341-351
